                My name is Abdel, i am 25 years old and i live in Ghent. I am currently following a webdevelopment
                course
                at a new organization called BeCode.
                I was always interested in writing codes but i never thought that i would excually do it,
                because i never did something with programming, so it's a new world for me.
                But I live my life by my favorit quote: </section>
            <blockquote> &quot;Great things never came from comfort zones&quot; </blockquote>
