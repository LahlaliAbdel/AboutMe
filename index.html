    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Abdel, i am 25 years old and i live in Ghent. I am currently following a webdevelopment course
        at a new organization called BeCode.
        I was always interested in writing codes but i never thought that i would excually do it,
        because i never did something with programming, so it's a new world for me.
        But I live my life by my favorit quote: </p>
    <blockquote> &quot;Great things never came from comfort zones&quot; </blockquote>


    <h1>BeCode</h1>

    <p> Becode is a new organization who teaches webdevelopment. They have a unique way to teach.

        The duration of the course is 7 months. In those 7 months, we will learn about:

        <h2> Git </h2>
        <p> Git is a version control system. It is a necessary tool for every self respecting developer.
            It enables you to log every change within a project in detail and to work together in the same file at the
            same time.</p>

        <h2> CSS </h2>
        <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.”
            While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs,
            and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s
            style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every
            house has one),
            and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century
            modern home).

        <h2> JavaScript </h2>
        <p> JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language.
            JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.
            In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript.
            JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development. </p>

        <h2> PHP </h2>
        <p> PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web
            applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor,
            that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages.
            PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.
            The client computers accessing the PHP scripts require a web browser only.
            A PHP file contains PHP tags and ends with the extension ".php".
